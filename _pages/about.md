The team focuses on Foundations of Machine Learning, and more specifically Reinforcement Learning as a framework to study Interactive Learning and Adaptive Systems. 

Our goal is to further the development and understanding of Machine Learning systems that continuously learn. This is a broad problem and we particularly focus on the question of data acquisition towards lifelong learning: How can an agent act now given previous experience and in anticipation of future tasks to come? 


#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
